# Real Estate Agency Smart Contract
## Overview
This is a smart contract for a real estate agency that allows minting, buying and selling properties on the blockchain. It is built on the Ethereum platform and uses the ERC-1155 token standard for non-fungible tokens.

## Features V1
The smart contract has the following features:

* Minting Properties: Property owners can mint new properties by paying the required agency fees.
* Buying Properties: Buyers can purchase properties by paying the required amount in Ether.
* IPFS Integration: The contract integrates with IPFS to store property metadata and make it available to buyers.
* Revenue Sharing: The contract keeps track of the revenue generated by each property and allows owners to withdraw their share.
* Agency Fees: The contract charges a percentage of the minting price as agency fees, which are collected by the contract owner.
* NFT Receipt: After a user buy a property, a NFT will get into his wallet with some metadata (can be set via IPFS and set to the contract using the `setIpfsHash(uint256 tokenId, uint256 subId, string memory hash)` - the hash can be an empty string.)

By default 100 value correspond to 1%, so setting 50 will represent 0.5%. The reason is because there is no decimal in solidity.

Mint new properties by calling the mintProperty function with the desired price.
Buy properties by calling the buyProperty function with the desired ID and amount of Ether.
